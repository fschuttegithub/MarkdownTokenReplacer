# MarkDown With Citations

## Purpose

This widget is designed to display text that comes in as Markdown while handling references in a clear and interactive way.  
Instead of leaving citation markers like `[1]`, `[2]` inline in the text, the widget collects these references and presents them as separate, clickable buttons.

## End Functionality

- Render Markdown text as normal, so users can read content with proper formatting.
- Detect citation markers (e.g., `[1]`, `[2]`) inside the text.
- Display a dedicated **Sources section** with buttons for each citation.
- Each button corresponds to the right source and allows the user to interact with it:
  - Open a link,
  - View more details about the source,
  - Or trigger further actions in the app.
- Keep the reading experience clean by separating the main text from the source details.
- Ensure users always have quick access to supporting information without breaking their reading flow.

## Goal

The end result is a widget that makes documents with references easier to read and navigate by combining standard Markdown rendering with an accessible, interactive way of working with sources.
